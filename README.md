# Uber Fare Prediction – Group Project for CSE 151A

## 📄 Abstract
We will be using the **Uber NYC For-Hire Vehicles Trip Data (2021)** dataset, which contains over 11 million trip records per month across New York City, including dispatching base license numbers, pickup and drop-off zones, trip distances, durations, and fare details such as base passenger fare, tips, tolls, and driver pay. Our project applies **decision tree regression** to uncover non-linear relationships between ride features and fare amounts, with the goal of identifying the key attributes that influence pricing. By analyzing temporal, spatial, and trip-specific features, we aim to uncover patterns such as peak-hour surcharges, distance-based pricing, and zone-specific fare differences. The interpretable structure of decision trees will enable us to highlight the most influential factors in fare variation, producing a model that both predicts fares accurately and provides insights into price-optimization strategies for ride-hailing services.
