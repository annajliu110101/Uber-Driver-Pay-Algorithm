# Uber Fare Prediction – Milestone 3

## 📄 Abstract
For Milestone 3, we extend our work on the **Uber NYC For-Hire Vehicles Trip Data (2024–2025)** by moving from exploratory analysis to **predictive modeling**.  
We focus on building a **GPU-accelerated Decision Tree Regression model (XGBoost)** to predict **base passenger fare** using trip and contextual features.  

This milestone highlights **feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model performance evaluation** on a large-scale dataset.

## 📌 Dataset
- **Source:** [NYC TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)  
- **Subset Used for Milestone 3:** `fhvhv_tripdata_2024-07.parquet`  
- **Size:** ~14,328,242 rows × 53 features  
- **Scope:** High Volume For-Hire Service (Uber) trips in NYC  

### Features
Engineered features included:
- Temporal: `request_hour`, `request_weekday`, `pickup_hour`, `pickup_weekday`  
- Derived: `wait_time_seconds`, rush-hour flags, weekend flag  
- Distance & Duration categories  
- Top 20 pickup/dropoff location one-hot features  

**Target Variable:**  
- `base_passenger_fare` (continuous)

---

## ⚙️ Pre-Processing
Steps included:
1. **Filtering** invalid zones (`PULocationID=264`, `DOLocationID=265`).  
2. **Feature engineering** for temporal, categorical, and ride-based patterns.  
3. **One-hot encoding** top pickup and dropoff locations.  
4. Train/validation/test split (80/10/10).

## 🚀 Modeling

We used **XGBoost Regressor with GPU acceleration** (`tree_method='hist', device='cuda:0'`).  
Hyperparameter tuning focused on the **max_depth** parameter, which controls tree complexity.  

### Depth Search Strategy
- Originally tested **depths 1 → 20**.  
- Found best models consistently in **10 → 15** range.  
- To save compute time, narrowed tuning to that range.  
- Final best depth was **12**.

## 📊 Results

### 1. Validation Error vs. Depth
We tested multiple depths, finding that validation error minimized at **depth=12**.

*(Generated from July 2024 dataset, ~14.3M rows)*

### 2. Shallow vs. Best Depth Comparison
We compared a shallow tree (`d=2`) vs. the best depth (`d=12`).  
The deeper model showed consistently lower RMSE across training, validation, and testing.

---

### Final Model Performance (Best depth = 12)
- **Test MSE:** ~96.62  
- **Test RMSE:** ~$9.83  
- **Most important features:**  
  - `distance_category`, `trip_miles`, `trip_time`, duration-related features, and specific pickup/dropoff zones.  

---

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- Distance-based features dominate fare prediction.  
- Temporal features (hour, weekday, rush-hour flags) and pickup/dropoff zones also play a key role.  
- Narrowing the depth range (10–15) significantly reduced tuning time without sacrificing accuracy.  

---

## 🔍 Model Fit Analysis
We originally tested **max_depth values from 1 to 20**, which gave a clear picture of underfitting vs. overfitting:  
- Depths 1–5: **Underfit** (high bias, high error).  
- Depths 16–20: **Overfit** (validation error increasing).  
- Depths 10–15: **Best balance**.  

➡️ The chosen model at depth 12 sits in the **sweet spot** of the fitting curve: not underfit, not overfit.  

➡️ **Next models to try:**  
- **SVMs** → margin-based performance, robustness to outliers.  
- **KNNs** → distance-based regression comparison.  
- **Naive Bayes** → lightweight categorical baseline.  

---

## 📝 Conclusion
Our first decision tree model (XGBoost, GPU) achieved:  
- **Best depth:** 12  
- **Final Test RMSE:** ~$9.83  
- **Key drivers:** distance category, trip miles, and trip time.  

This confirms that **distance and geography dominate fare prediction**, while temporal features play a smaller role.  

➡️ **Future improvements:**  
- Add **regularization** to reduce overfitting.  
- Bring in **external data** (weather, traffic, surge pricing).  
- Try **ensembles** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, stacking).  

This model establishes a strong baseline for fare prediction and prepares us for deeper experimentation in Milestone 4.
